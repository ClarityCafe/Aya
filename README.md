# Project Aya: the globally-distributed waifu repository

Project Aya is a IPFS-powered booru service. Unlike traditional boorus using S3 or Object Storage, we rely on a network of CDNs already implemented by multiple parties.

For now nothing is not yet in stone here but if you wanna check the roadmap, check out our issues.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/Vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Contributing

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy Aya is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://zeit.co/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out Vercel's [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
